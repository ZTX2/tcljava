This message is to announce the new 1.3.3 release of Jacl and
Tcl Blend.  These releases are the result of efforts by Mo DeJong
and the Jacl and Tcl Blend user community.

The 1.3.3 release of Jacl and Tcl Blend are available for
downloading at the following URL:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13005

The 1.3.3 version is a "production" ready release, it is
considered stable enough to be used on an everyday basis.
The code in this release is already being used by customers
in production environments on a daily basis.

What's New in the 1.3.3 Release?
----------------------------------

The 1.3.3 release includes only important bug fixes. Jacl's
exec command has been fixed so that subprocess reading threads
will not deadlock. Tcl Blend's Interp.evalFile() API
has been implemented, it no longer raises an exception when
invoked. The configure script has been fixed so that the
--prefix option will default to /usr/local instead of
generating path related errors. Jacl's lsort -dictionary
command has been fixed so that sort order matches that
of Tcl 8.4.

See the new_features.txt and changes.txt files for more info.

What is Jacl?
----------------

Jacl is a 100% Java implementation of Tcl 8.  This allows Tcl to run
in more environments and also brings the power of scripting to Java
developers.  Jacl implements almost all the features available in
the C version of Tcl and is well tested.

What is Tcl Blend?
------------------------

Tcl Blend is a Tcl Extension that allows you to have access to the
Java VM from the Tcl interpreter.  The goal here is to allow Tcl
developers to write new Tcl extensions in Java rather then C or C++
for better portability.  A developer can also load both Tcl and
Tcl Blend into an existing Java JVM. Tcl Blend is known to work on
Solaris, Windows 95/NT/XP, IRIX, and Linux. Other systems have not
been tested but it should be easy to port Tcl Blend to any system
that supports dynamic loading and the Java JNI interface.
